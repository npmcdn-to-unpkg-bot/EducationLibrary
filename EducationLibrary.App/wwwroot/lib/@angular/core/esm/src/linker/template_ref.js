 * Represents an Embedded Template that can be used to instantiate Embedded Views.
 *
 * You can access a `TemplateRef`, in two ways. Via a directive placed on a `<template>` element (or
 * directive prefixed with `*`) and have the `TemplateRef` for this Embedded View injected into the
 * constructor of the directive using the `TemplateRef` Token. Alternatively you can query for the
 * `TemplateRef` from a Component or a Directive via {@link Query}.
 *
 * To instantiate Embedded Views based on a Template, use
 * {@link ViewContainerRef#createEmbeddedView}, which will create the View and attach it to the
 * View Container.

     *
